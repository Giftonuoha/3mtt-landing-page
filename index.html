    <!-- Objective
    The goal of this project is to design and develop a responsive landing page for a fictional product or service using HTML and CSS. The page should be visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and structured for a great user experience.

    Task Breakdown

    Create a Hero Section
    Include a headline that introduces the product or service.
    Add a subheadline that provides a short description or value proposition.
    Include a call-to-action (CTA) button (e.g., "Sign Up Now," "Learn More").

    Build a Responsive Features Section
    Create a three-column layout to highlight key features.
    Each column should have:
    A small icon or image representing the feature.
    A title for the feature.
    A short description explaining the feature.
    Ensure the section adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., stacks into a single column on mobile).

    Design a Footer Section
    Include contact details (email, phone number, or social media links).
    Add copyright information or a short message.

    Requirements
    ✅ Use HTML and CSS (no JavaScript required).
    ✅ Ensure responsive design using CSS Flexbox or Grid.
    ✅ Implement proper semantic HTML structure for accessibility. -->
